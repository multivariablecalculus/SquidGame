# SquidGame Website

This is just a fun approach to IPv4-IPv6 logging and database hosting, it includes topics like list management, static website hosting, HTML web pages design, and CSS boosting... even though HTML is not a programming language. This has Python in the form of Flask, JS, HTML, CSS and other stuff like JSON as times, and most importantly, it has MongoDB.

Anyway, do consider registering if you think your IP is safe enough, because registering means me having your IPv4 and IPv6.
